How to Use:
To use the application, open it and use log-in credentials to log in. From the main screen, you can choose to view
customers, appointments, or reports. In the customers view you can add, edit, and delete customers. In the appointments
view you can add, edit, and delete appointments, view them by month or week, or search for an appointment. In the
reports view, you can view four different reports. The additional report I chose to run was a login-attempt report
table that shows a timestamp, userID, userName, and if the login was successful.
